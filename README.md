# VLSI SoC Design using Verilog HDL
I have completed the  course <b>VLSI SoC Design using Verilog HDL</b> from Maven Silicon. <u><i>https://elearn.maven-silicon.com/course/VLSISoCDesignusingVerilogHDL-35</u></i>



## Deployment

To deploy this project clone this github repository and extract the files to VS Code. 

Navigate to the particular  folder and open a new terminal window 

```
  iverilog -o sim xxx_tb.v
```
where sim is the simulation output and xxx is either of the seven logic gates. 


A simulation output of sim is created as the output file . To generate the timing diagram of sim , enter 
```
vvp sim
```
A timing diagram of xxx_waveform.vcd will be generated as timing diagram file. We can view it in GTKWave using the following command
```
gtkwave xxx_waveform.vcd
```

A timing diagram will be generated by GTKwave Analyser. We can analyse the output signals as per our requirement.
